# MultipleViewsJavaFX-Exercise

Create an application that contains three separate views. The views are as follows:

    The layout of the first view is done with the help of the BorderPane class. At the top there is the text "First view!". The center of the view contains a button with the text "To the second view!". By pressing that button the application swithces to the second view.

    The layout of the second view is done with the help of the VBox class. The first element in the layout is a button with the text "To the third view!" in it â€” by pressing the button the application switches to the third view. The button is followed by the text "Second view!".

    The third view uses the GridPane class for its layout. At the coordinates (0, 0) there is a text that reads "Third view!". At coordinates (1, 1) there is a button with the text "To the first view!". Pressing this button brings back the first view.

When first started, the program should display the first view.
